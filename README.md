### AI Techniques

**EstateWise** combines a modern API, real‑time chat, and a responsive UI with a powerful AI stack to deliver hyper‑personalized property recommendations:

- **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses Pinecone for kNN‑based vector retrieval, then fuses retrieved data into generated responses.
- **k‑Means Clustering:** Automatically groups similar listings and finds closest matches to refine recommendations.
  - All features are also normalized to a range of 0-1 for better clustering and kNN performance.
- **Decision AI Agent:** Decides whether to fetch RAG data (via `queryProperties`); if yes, it pulls in the Pinecone results, otherwise it skips straight to the Mixture‑of‑Experts pipeline.
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** Dynamically routes each query through a master model to select specialized sub‑models (Data Analyst, Lifestyle Concierge, Financial Advisor, Neighborhood Expert, Cluster Analyst) for maximal relevance.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Each expert uses a CoT approach to break down complex queries into manageable steps, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.
- **Feedback Loop & Reinforcement Learning:** Users rate responses; thumbs‑up/down adjust expert weights per conversation, and the system continuously learns to improve accuracy.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Each expert has a unique prompt template, ensuring tailored responses based on user input.
  - All experts, agents, and merger have a detailed and ultra-specific prompt template to ensure the best possible responses.
- **kNN & Cosine Similarity:** Uses Pinecone for fast, real‑time property retrieval based on user queries.

## Features

EstateWise is packed with both UI and AI features to enhance your home-finding experience:

- **Intelligent Property Recommendations**  
  Get tailored property suggestions powered by AI and Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG).

- **Secure User Authentication**  
  Sign up, log in, and log out with JWT‑based security.

- **Conversation History**

  - **Authenticated users** can view, rename, and delete past chats.
  - **Guest users** still have their conversation history saved locally in the browser.

- **Full‑Text Search**  
  Quickly search your conversation history for keywords, topics, or specific properties.

- **Rating System & Feedback Loop**  
  Rate each AI response (thumbs up/down) to adjust expert weights and continuously improve recommendations.

- **Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE) & Manual Expert View**

  - The AI dynamically routes queries through specialized experts (Data Analyst, Lifestyle Concierge, Financial Advisor, Neighborhood Expert, Cluster Analyst).
  - There is a master merger model that synthesizes the responses from all experts.
  - Optionally switch to any single expert’s view to see their raw recommendation.

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**  
  Each expert uses a CoT approach to break down complex queries into manageable steps, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.

- **Interactive Visualizations**

  - In‑chat, the AI generates live Chart.js graphs from Pinecone data so you can instantly see trends and distributions.
  - A dedicated Visualizations page offers aggregate charts and insights for all Chapel Hill properties.

- **Clustering & Similarity Search**

  - k‑Means clustering groups similar properties for more focused suggestions.
  - kNN & Cosine Similarity (via Pinecone) finds the closest matches to your query in real time.

- **Smooth Animations**  
  Engaging transitions and micro‑interactions powered by Framer Motion.

## Setup & Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot.git
   cd EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables (adjust as needed):

   ```env
   PORT=<your_port>
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=<your_google_ai_api_key>
   PINECONE_API_KEY=<your_pinecone_api_key>
   PINECONE_INDEX=estatewise-index
   ```

   Important: Be sure that you created the Pinecone index with the name `estatewise-index` in your Pinecone account before proceeding. Then,
   add data to the index using the `pinecone` CLI or API. For security purposes, our properties data is not publicly available in the repository. Please use your own data.

4. **Upsert Properties Data to Pinecone:**  
   Use the `upsertProperties.ts` script to upsert your properties data into the Pinecone index. This script assumes that you place the 4 JSON files in the same directory as the script itself,
   under the names `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part0.json`, `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part1.json`, `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part2.json`, and `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part3.json`.

   ```bash
   ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/scripts/upsertProperties.ts
   ```

   Alternatively, and preferably, you can use the following NPM command from the `backend` directory to quickly upsert the properties data:

   ```bash
   npm run upsert
   ```

   Note that it may take quite long to upsert all the 30,772 properties data into the Pinecone index, so please be patient.

5. **Run the Backend in Development Mode:** After the properties data has been upserted into the Pinecone index, you can run the backend server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the backend server with live reloading.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the client folder:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Change API URL:**  
   If your backend is running on a different port or domain, update the API URL in the frontend code (simply CTRL + F or CMD + F and search for our official backend API URL in all frontend files, then replace it with your backend URL - by default it is `http://localhost:3001`).

5. **View and Interact with the App:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app. You can interact with the chatbot, sign up, log in, and explore the features.

> [!CAUTION]
> As you develop, before committing, we recommend running the linter and formatter to ensure code quality with `npm run format`. This will format your code according to the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations.

## Deployment

Our app is fully deployed/hosted on the cloud using modern, powerful tech stacks (AWS, GCP, Terraform, Vercel, and more)! Below are its specifics:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

  - **Terraform**: Provision VPC, subnets, Internet Gateway, ECS/Fargate cluster & service, ALB, IAM roles, and security groups via the `terraform/` modules.
  - **CloudFormation**: Modular templates under `aws/cloudformation/` for VPC, IAM roles, ECS cluster/task/service, and ALB if you prefer AWS’s native IaC.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**

  - **GitHub Actions**: Builds, tests, and pushes Docker images to AWS ECR or Google Artifact Registry, then triggers deployments.
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: (Optional) Fully AWS-native pipeline—CodeBuild builds & pushes your image, CodePipeline deploys to ECS via Fargate.
  - **GCP Cloud Build**: Builds and pushes containers to Artifact Registry and deploys the backend to Cloud Run using `gcp/cloudbuild.yaml`.

- **Backend**

  - **AWS ECS (Fargate)**: Containerized Node/TypeScript API hosted on ECS behind an Application Load Balancer, with autoscaling.
  - **GCP Cloud Run**: Serverless container deployment option via Cloud Build; autoscaling to zero when idle.
  - **Vercel** (Backup): Node server largely stateless, can run on Vercel for smaller workloads.
  - _Env vars_ managed in Secrets Manager (AWS) or Secret Manager (GCP).

- **Frontend**

  - **Vercel**: Primary host for the Next.js/React UI with edge caching.
  - **Netlify** (Backup): Can also deploy static build artifacts with environment overrides for API endpoints.
  - **S3 + CloudFront**: (Optional) Host `out/` export of Next.js as static site, fronted by a CDN.

- **Data Stores**

  - **MongoDB Atlas**: Global, fully managed MongoDB for user data and chat histories.

## Dockerization

To run the application **(OPTIONAL)** using Docker:

1. Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. In the project root directory, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This command builds and starts both the backend and frontend services as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

However, you don't need to run the app using Docker. You can run the backend and frontend separately as described in the **Setup & Installation** section.

## Prometheus Monitoring & Visualizations

Prometheus is used for monitoring the backend server. It collects metrics from the server and provides a web interface to visualize them.

Metrics collected & visualized include:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Heap usage
- Load average
- Event loops
- Requests per second
- Status codes
- Response times

To view our live server metrics, go to [this link](https://estatewise-backend.vercel.app/metrics) in your browser. This will show you the raw metrics of our server collected by Prometheus. If you are running the app locally, you can go to `http://localhost:3001/metrics` in your browser.

To view our live server data, go to [this URL](https://estatewise-backend.vercel.app/status) in your browser. If you are running the app locally, you can go to `http://localhost:3001/status` in your browser.

</p>

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of the application. It automatically runs tests, builds the Docker images, and deploys the application to Vercel or AWS whenever changes are pushed to the main branch or when pull requests are created.

To view the GitHub Actions workflow, go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/hoangsonww/EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot/actions) of this repository. You can see the status of the latest runs, view logs, and check for any errors.

Our pipeline is set up to run the following steps:

* **Linting:** Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues, enforcing consistent standards across the codebase.
* **Formatting:** Uses Prettier to automatically format code according to project style guidelines.
* **Testing:** Executes unit tests for both the backend (Jest) and frontend (Jest), ensuring that all functionality works as expected.
* **End-to-End Testing:** Runs Cypress and Selenium tests to validate user interactions in a real browser environment.
* **Security Scanning:** Includes CodeQL analysis, `npm audit`, Semgrep, and license checks to detect known vulnerabilities and license conflicts.
* **Build:** Compiles both the frontend and backend code, preparing optimized production artifacts.
* **Database Connectivity Check:** Validates that environment database credentials are correct and that the app can reach its database instances.
* **Performance Testing:** Runs Lighthouse for web performance metrics and Artillery for load testing of critical endpoints.
* **Docker Publishing:** Builds and pushes Docker images for both the frontend and backend to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for security issues before deployment.
* **Documentation Generation:** Builds JSDoc and TypeDoc documentation and stores the results as build artifacts.
* **Deployment:** Automates infrastructure deployments to AWS and application deployments to Vercel.
* **Final Confirmation:** Marks the pipeline as successfully completed after all previous steps pass.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/github-actions.png" alt="GitHub Actions CI/CD" width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px" />
</p>

This ensures that the application is always in a deployable state and that any issues are caught early in the development process.

## Testing

The application includes unit tests for both the backend and frontend components. These tests ensure that the application functions correctly and that any changes made do not break existing functionality.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. **Backend Unit & Integration Tests:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Run the tests using the following command:

     ```bash
     npm run test
     
     # or run with watch mode (recommended for development - reruns tests on file changes)
     npm run test:watch
     
     # or run with coverage report (recommended for CI/CD - generates a coverage report)
     npm run test:coverage
     ```
   - This command runs the unit tests defined in the `src/tests` directory using Jest.

2. **Frontend Unit & Integration Tests:**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Run the tests using the following command:

     ```bash
     npm run test
     
     # or run with watch mode (recommended for development - reruns tests on file changes)
     npm run test:watch
     
     # or run with coverage report (recommended for CI/CD - generates a coverage report)
     npm run test:coverage
     ```
   - This command runs the unit tests defined in the `__tests__` directory using Jest and React Testing Library.

3. **Frontend E2E Tests:**
   - For end-to-end tests, we use Cypress and Selenium WebDriver. 
   - To run the Selenium E2E tests, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

     ```bash
     npm run test:selenium
     ```
     
    - To run the Cypress E2E tests, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
  
      ```bash
      npm run cypress:run
      
      # to open the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode, run:
      npm run cypress:open
      ```
      
    - This command runs the end-to-end tests defined in the `cypress/integration` directory using Cypress.

These tests cover various aspects of the application, including:
- **Unit Tests:** Individual components and functions to ensure they behave as expected.
- **Integration Tests:** Multiple components working together to ensure they interact correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulating user interactions to ensure the entire application flow works as intended.

## OpenAPI Specification

An OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.yaml`) is included in the root directory. You can use Swagger UI or Postman to explore and test the API endpoints.

> [!TIP]
> Note: It may not be the latest and most updated version of the API specification, so please refer to the [Swagger API Documentation](#swagger-api-documentation) for the most up-to-date information.

## JSDoc & TypeDoc

We use **JSDoc** and **TypeDoc** to generate developer-friendly documentation for the project.

### JSDoc (for JavaScript)

1. Install:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jsdoc
   ```

2. Configure `jsdoc.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "source": {
       "include": ["backend", "frontend"],
       "includePattern": ".js$"
     },
     "opts": {
       "destination": "docs",
       "recurse": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
   ```

Open `docs/index.html` to view.

### TypeDoc (for TypeScript)

1. Install:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev typedoc
   ```

2. Generate backend docs:

   ```bash
   npm run typedoc:backend
   ```

3. Generate frontend docs:

   ```bash
   npm run typedoc:frontend
   ```

The generated HTML will be in `docs-backend/` and `docs-frontend/`. Open the respective `index.html` files to view.

For more details, see [jsdoc.app](https://jsdoc.app) and [typedoc.org](https://typedoc.org).

## Containerization

The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent, portable, and reproducible builds across different environments.

* **Backend and Frontend Dockerfiles:**
  The `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile` define how to build the container images for their respective services. They include steps to install dependencies, build the code, and configure the production servers.

* **GitHub Actions Integration:**
  As part of the CI/CD pipeline, the workflow automatically builds these Docker images after testing and linting have succeeded. It uses the `docker/build-push-action@v5` to build the images and then push them to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

* **Image Scanning:**
  Once the images are built and published, they are scanned for vulnerabilities using Trivy in the pipeline to catch any security issues before deployment.

* **docker-compose Usage (Local):**
  For local development or quick testing, a `docker-compose.yml` file is included. This file defines both the backend and frontend containers, along with their dependencies, allowing you to spin up the entire stack with a single command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

* **Deployment:**
  In production, the images are pulled directly from GHCR and deployed to AWS infrastructure or Vercel, enabling a consistent artifact to run from local to production.

This approach ensures faster onboarding for developers, simplifies deployments, and minimizes environment drift.

## VS Code Extension

We have developed a VSCode extension to enhance the development experience with **EstateWise**. This extension provides features such as:

- **Instant Chat Access**  
  Open the EstateWise chatbot directly in VS Code via the Command Palette (`Estatewise Chat: Open Chat`).

- **Persistent Webview Panel**  
  Keeps your conversation context alive even when the panel is hidden or you switch files.

- **Configurable Panel**  
  Customize the panel title, target editor column, iframe width/height, script permissions, and auto‑open behavior via VS Code settings.

- **Secure Embedding**  
  Loads the chatbot through a sandboxed iframe with a strict Content‑Security‑Policy, so all logic remains safely hosted on `https://estatewise.vercel.app/chat`.

- **Zero Backend Overhead**  
  No extra server or API keys required in VS Code—everything runs through the existing EstateWise web app.

- **Easy Installation**  
  Install the `.vsix` package locally or grab it from the VS Code Marketplace, then start chatting with EstateWise without leaving your editor.
